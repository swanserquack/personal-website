<p>Hello and welcome to this second blog post on this website. This post is going to be about ethical hacking
<br> and my view on it. Sit back and enjoy this rant.</p>
<br>
<p>For you to be able to understand this you first have to understand what ethical hacking is. Ethical hacking
<br> is when a company pays an individual or comapny to try to break into their company and gain sensitive info
<br> from it. Most ethical hackers go solo and ofering freelance work but there are a few companies which offer
<br>this as a service.</p>
<br>
<p>From my own knowledge most ethical hackers prefer to either use <a href="https://www.kali.org/" class="link">kali linux</a> or <a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/" class="link">parrot OS</a> due to their high amounts
<br>of preinstalled tools and privacy and versitility it offers (As well as literally daily updates). Since I don't have 
<br>another physical machine to run it on, I just ran it as a 1 core, 8GB RAM machine running of my 1TB USB HDD. As you
<br>can imagine it was pretty painful(It took 3 hours to install <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus" class="link">nessus</a>.) to use with it just having one core but apart from that
<br> it was pretty fast to use. I then used <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" class="link">TryHackMe</a> to learn about the various tools that were on the system. I learned how to 
<br> effectivly use <a href="https://nmap.org/" class="link">nmap</a>,<a href="https://www.metasploit.com/" class="link"> metasploit</a> and <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/" class="link">hashcat</a> (Among other things). There is a lot I have learned from this experience
<br> and I have a new found knowledge of nmap and hashcat and Burp Suite and tools like that. Maybe another day I might
<br>go back to doing ethical hacking and finding vulnerabilities but for now I'm doing nothing and just cementing my
<br>knowledge of the subject.</p>
<br>
<p>Thanks for reading this rant and about my ethical hacking journey.</p>
<br>
<p>Peace,
