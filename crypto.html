<p>Welcome to my latest blog post on this, my not so secret website.
<br>Todays blog post will be about cryptocurrency, what it means, what it is and what I do with it.</p>


<p><b>What is crypto</b></p>

<p>Crypto or cryptocurrency as it is sometimes called is a form ofwhich is entirely online and has
<br>no regulation from any governments or any central authority. It is mined (A term I will explain
<br> later) by the people and they are in control of their money and they can choose what to do with
<br>it.</p>
<br>


<p><b>Types of Crypto</b></p>

<p>The most popular and well-known crypto of all is proberly Bitcoin. Although lots of people know about
<br>bitcoin, most dont know how it functions behind the scenes. While Bitcoin advertises itself as a 
<br>private crypto it isn't really private because anyone can just logon to a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer" class="link">bitcoin explorer</a>
<br>and look at all your transaction details such as who its going to, who sent it, and how much. 
<br>The 2nd most popular crypto is Ethereum which hovers around £1,000 to £1,500 pounds. While this
<br>is pale in comparison to the aroun £25,000 of bitcoin, it is currently the most profitible to mine.
<br>There are many other crypto's out there but the one I believe in the most and mine myself is
<br><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" class="link">Monero</a> which really is a private coin unlike Bitcoin. Monero is also ASIC proof and is mainly
<br> mined using CPU power. Now that's out the way lets move on to mining</p>
<br>


<p><b>Mining Crypto</b></p>

<p>The process of mining crypto varies between what crypto you are mining. I will explain CPU, GPU and ASIC mining.
<br>First I'm going to explain the overall mining process to you. When you mine, you are trying to match up a 
<br>hash with the hash given to you by the pool (In pool mining) or by your own node(If your solo mining). You 
<br>try to go through every possible variation of hash to try to find the one that matches. If you find a 
<br>hash that matches then you send it off and you get a reward for finding it. This is a watered down 
<br>version of it but these are the basics. 
<br>
<br>Then you have pool and solo mining, in pool mining you dont
<br>host a node and the pool you mine on gives everyone a hash to work on (together) and if someone
<br>finds that hash then everyone gets a bit of the prize depending on how much you helped with the 
<br>finding of that hash. Solo mining is when you run off your own local node and you mine alone
<br>so if you find a correct hash, you get all of the rewards instead of only a bit on how much you
<br>helped. Solo mining is generally better when you have a lot of strong machines capabile of getting
<br>a high hash rate and pool mining is better when you have weak machines. 
<br>
<br>Finally you have CPU,GPU and ASIC mining. CPU mining is like the name suggests, you try to find a 
<br>matching hash using your CPU power. Not many cryptos support CPU mining because generally GPU's
<br>are faster but there are some which do support CPU mining. GPU mining is like CPU mining but
<br>instead you use your GPU to mine andthis is generally the main way to mine Bitcoin, ETH etc.
<br>This is what some heavy miners use to profit, they just but like an i3 processor and then get
<br>Ryzers, Mining Frame, GPU's and storage. You then construct it like a normal PC and then run
<br>mining software like NiceHash or other CLI miners and start mining. Finally the most expensive
<br>but the most profitible mining method, ASIC mining. ASIC stands for Application Specific Intregated
<br>Circuit. Its just basically a PC but with only <b>ONE</b> purpose... to mine cyrptocurrency. These
<br>are little machines about the size of these HP PC's which just mine crypto, they have no other purpose,
<br>you cannot do anything else with these machines. Some other drawbacks are that they suck electricity
<br>like my excitement level when our wifi goes down (Pretty high), they produce a ton of heat and they are
<br>pretty load to run. However the positives are that they can can be really profitible, with the most 
<br>profitible miner being the StrongU STU-U1++ with when you pay 1p per K/KWh then you can get around £49
<br>profit <b>every day</b> which is a lot but the price is about £5k for one machine not to include
<br>the money you have to spend to put in specialist plugs to handle the wattage and other costs.
<br>Overall ASIC's are good investments if you have a lot of money and you are prepared to make the 
<br>investment.
<br>To sum up if you want to mine in your spare time then do CPU mining, if you want to mine
<br>semi-professionally then GPU mine or if you want to full time mine then get some ASIC's.
<br>
<br>Note:I forgot to mention there are some home ASIC miners which are made to just plug in and it
<br>will mine while taking a normal amount of electricity and produces very little noise and heat.
<br>However the downside is that it is not going to be as profitible but you can still make about 
<br>£5 from one 1 know while running of normal mains electricity.</p>
<br>

<p><b>Sum Up</b></p>
<p>To sum up, mining is a good way to make a secondary income without tons and tons of effort,
<br>however it is not easy to know what you are doing without a bit of knowledge first. Therefore
<br>I would not reccommend mining unless you 100% know what you are doing and have a decent knowledge of 
<br>crypto.</p>
