<p>Hello and welcome to the first ever blog post on my website. In this post I will outline
<br> my intentions for this website and what the purpose of it is.</p>

<br>
<p>First of all my purpose for this website:</p>
<p>My original prupose for this website was just to make it and just maybe work on it once
<br>in a while but after more time passed I just had more free time on my hands so I decided
<br>to just set this as my main focus and then this website just sprouted from there,
<br>I have learned a lot from the making of this post and the overall setup of this website
<br>so thats the purpose of this website... to expand my knowledge and to make sure my skills
<br>stay sharp.</p>

<br>
<p>Next thing on the agenda is my intentions:</p>
<p>My intentions for this website is to reflect my journey through high school and all the things it poses (Among o-
<br>ther things). Kind of like a personal journal only its not personal since the admins of the shared server can e-
<br>nter my folder and see it and <b>this</b> as well (Since I suspect its just a partition of a drive). To round up this
<br> is just goingto be a journal for no one but me and the server admin (or root) to see</p>

<p>So to round up, this is my personal journal for all things in school and not in school. This is just a spare time thing
<br>so it will only be updated when I have spare time in class</p>

<p>Peace,
<br>swanserquack</p>
