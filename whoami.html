<p>Like on the main page heres a little bit more about me</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a decent knowledge of <a href="https://nmap.org/" class="link">nmap</a> and Metasploit and basic ethical hacking.</li>
<li>I also have a medium amount of knowledge of HTML and basic knowledge of CSS</li>
<li>I have a better version of this website at home but I'm just doing this in my spare time</li>
<li>I have also setup <strike>process of setting up</strike> <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" class="link">monero</a> mining on my Lenovo Ideapad 330S, Raspberry Pi 4 and <strike>Nokia 5.3</strike> because monero is worth a decent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/monero" class="link">amount</a> and it is profitible to mine on moneroocean due to its 0% pool fee.</li>
<li>I want a PC but my parents say I have to save up by myself so I have to.</li>
</ul>
